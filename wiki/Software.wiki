The Twittoid will be divided in some big components.

*Please edit this section if whatever is wrong. I've never been using twitter so you know this system better.*



= UI =
  * Technologies: Plasma and Plexy (both independent UIs).

Here we should be able to select if we can see all messages for all TL¹ or for one specific. It would be like a filter.
The same about posting a new message. We should be able to post it to a specific TL or to all TL's.
It will show like kdetwitter our followings' pictures and our picture near the post form.

¹I mean TL (Twitter Like) as for those different microblogging webpages: Twitter, Jisko, Blip, etc.

= !SingletonEngine =
  * Store configuration (ConfigurationStorage)
    * configuration are "abstract" (configTO?)
  * Can connect to website (ConnectionManager)
  * Returns to service data from website (json datas for microblog)
  * Send to UI Items per message from microblogs (Items are abstract? We need ItemInterface?)
  * Load plugins (?)

== !AbstractServices ==
This superclass will provide services for the different types of webservices we have nowadays (Microblogging, Pictures, Online Calendars...).
  * Microblog:
  This will be the interface through we will be able to use plugins. Microblog will be the only class which manages Plugins, so another classes won't have direct access to plugins.


== ItemInterface ==
Item described parsed data which engine send to UI.

= Config =
  * Technologies: QT

It has it's own UI. Maybe similar like Kopete for adding new TL's.

Plasma should help us to store preferences with KConfigGroup.

TODO: Login/passwords database? Where where we can store it? (KWallet?)

Menda: KWallet would be good imho, but i don't know if we have more alternatives.
