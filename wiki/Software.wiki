The Twittoid should be divided in tasks.

*Please edit this section if whatever is wrong. I've never been using twitter so you know this system better.*



== UI ==
  * Technologies:

Here we should be able to select if we can see all messages for all TL¹ or for one specific. It would be like a filter.
The same about posting a new message. We should be able to post it to a specific TL or to all TL's.
It will show like kdetwitter our followings' pictures and our picture near the post form.

¹I mean TL (Twitter Like) as for those different microblogging webpages: Twitter, Jisko, Blip, etc.


== Engine ==
  * Load plugins (ServiceInterface)
  * Store configuration (ConfigurationStorage)
    * configuration are "abstract" (configTO?)
  * Can connect to website (ConnectionManager)
  * Returns to service data from website (json datas for microblog)
  * Send to UI Items per message from microblogs (Items are abstract? We need ItemInterface?)


*ServicesInterface*

*ItemInterface*:
  * ???? :D
Item described parsed data which engine send to ui

*ConfigurationStorage*:
  * save configTO
  * load configTO


*ConfigTO*:
  * login
  * password
  * website url


*ConnectionManager*:
  * connect to website
  * return data

== Config ==
  * Technologies: QT

It has it's own UI. Maybe similar like Kopete for adding new TL's.

Plasma should help us to store preferences with KConfigGroup.

TODO: Login/passwords database? Where where we can store it? (KWallet?)

Menda: KWallet would be good imho, but i don't know if we have more alternatives.
