The Twittoid should be divided in tasks.
*Please edit this section if whatever is wrong. I've never been using twitter so you know this system better.*

==UI==
Here we should be able to select if we can see all messages for all TL¹ or for one specific. It would be like a filter.
The same about posting a new message. We should be able to post it to a specific TL or to all TL's.
It will show like kdetwitter our followings' pictures and our picture near the post form.

¹I mean TL (Twitter Like) as for those different microblogging webpages: Twitter, Jisko, Blip, etc.

==Services Plugin==
The way it works:
Services->Microblog (Service)->Jisko (Plugin).
So now through the services class we should be able to operate with Jisko.
